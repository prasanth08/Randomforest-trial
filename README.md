2. Dataset Description 

GISETTE is a handwritten digit recognition problem. The problem is to
separate the highly confusible digits '4' and '9'. The digits are size
-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of dimension 28x28. A number
of distractor features called 'probes' having no predictive power are also
present. The order of the features and patterns are randomized. Attribute
information is not provided to avoid biasing the feature selection process.

Data type: non-sparse
